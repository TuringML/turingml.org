## Develop

TuringML was built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) version 3.3.1, but should support newer versions as well.

Install the dependencies with [Bundler](http://bundler.io/):

```bash
$ bundle install
```

Run `jekyll` commands through Bundler to ensure you're using the right versions:

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

### Contact Form

* Preconfigured to work with CloudCannon, but easily changed to another provider (e.g. [FormSpree](https://formspree.io/)).
* Sends email to the address listed in company details.

### Staff

* Reused around the site to save multiple editing locations.
* Add `excluded_in_search: true` to any documentation page's front matter to exclude that page in the search results.

### Navigation

* Exposed as a data file to give clients better access.
* Set in the *Data* / *Navigation* section.

### Footer

* Exposed as a data file to give clients better access.
* Set in the *Data* / *Footer* section.
